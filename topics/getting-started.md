### Playlists
A playlist is a collection of messages. A playlist called 'Custom Playlist' is created automatically and contains the weather message. Add your new message to it. You can create additional playlists if you want to show different content at different times.

The custom playlist is already scheduled to run on your screen so at this point you can preview your screen by going to the Screens tab and clicking the preview link. Once it looks good, you are ready to purchase a player and connect it to your TV. 

## #3 Screens

Once you have created a Sign Presenter account and configured your screen(s) the next step is to connect a player. You will need an [Amazon Fire Stick](https://amzn.to/3letCr1) or any Android device running 10.0 or newer. This is what you will plug into your TV to run the digital signage software. You can find these at most Best Buy and Target stores or online at [Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/3letCr1). See [this article](https://support.signpresenter.com/topics/devicessignpresenterworkson.html) on our support page to find the best device for your needs.

After you've obtained your Device, simply plug it into your TV and enter your WiFi information. You will be asked to log into an Amazon or Google account or create a new one as part of the setup process. There will also likely be some software updates available after you connect the device for the first time. We recommend you download these updates before installing the Sign Presenter app.

There are two ways to install the Sign Presenter application on the Fire Stick. The first is from the device itself, click the "Search" icon in the top left corner and type in or say "Sign Presenter". 

The second way is from your browser. Go to the [Sign Presenter app page](https://www.amazon.com/Sign-Presenter/dp/B07V4GF4SZ/) in the Amazon app store
or  [Sign Presenter app page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.signpresenter.player) in the Google Play Store.
Select the device you wish to deliver the app to and click the deliver link. It should show up on your player home screen a few minutes later.

Once the app is installed you will see a 4 digit code you will need to login to your  [SignPresenter Account](https://support.signpresenter.com/) click on Step #3 Screens choose the screen on the left hand side then click Pair TV.
