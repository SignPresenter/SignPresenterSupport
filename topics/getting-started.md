### Playlists
A playlist is a collection of messages. A playlist called 'Custom Playlist' is created automatically and contains the weather message. Add your new message to it. You can create additional playlists if you want to show different content at different times.

The custom playlist is already scheduled to run on your screen so at this point you can preview your screen by going to the Screens tab and clicking the preview link. Once it looks good, you are ready to purchase a player and connect it to your TV. See the installation instructions below.
