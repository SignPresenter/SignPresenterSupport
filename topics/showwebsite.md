## Using the Show Website Function

The Show website message is made for showing your own website which generally do not have any problems, however some larger websites do block xframe which is needed if they 
are blcked you will see this "x-frame-options", "content-security-policy" in the header of that site.

https://abcnews.go.com/ is an example of a site that does not block this. 

If a website is not working most likley it is bbecause it is being blocked.
