## Issue with Older Firesticks


- Older Fire-sticks: We are currently still running a legacy version of the app 1.9.9 it does work on some older Firesticks but because of their age they are not able to keep up with some videos. You will know you have one of these devices if SignPresenter requires you to login instead of pairing the firestick from the website. 
- The biggest issue is sometimes you will see a screen like this.

If this is happing to you we recomend updating the firestick with a [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3letCr1)

You can also follow the below steps to set the resoultion on the stick this will make the issue happen less but is not a complete fix.

Click home on the fire-stick to exit out of SignPresenter
