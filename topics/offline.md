## Before You Go Offline

### Step 1: Verify All Content is Cached

1. While connected to WiFi, check your screen's **Cache Size** in the Screens tab
2. Make sure the cache shows all items are downloaded (e.g., "255 of 255")
3. **Only cached content will work offline** - content not fully downloaded won't display

### Step 2: Test Your Playlist

1. Click **Preview** or **Run Schedule** to make sure all slides are displaying correctly
2. Verify everything loads without errors

### Step 3: Set Schedule to 24/7

**Important:** If using Run Schedule, set your screen to run **24/7**.

Why? Fire Sticks don't keep accurate time when unplugged. If you move the device to a new location, the time may be incorrect, causing scheduled content not to display. Running 24/7 ensures your content always plays.

## Taking Your Fire Stick Offline

### Disconnect WiFi While Still Online

**Do this BEFORE unplugging your device.** This ensures any partial downloads complete and prevents errors.

**Option 1: Turn Off WiFi (Newer Fire Sticks)**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Network**
2. Select **WiFi**
3. Turn **WiFi Off**

**Option 2: Forget Network (Older Fire Stick 4K models)**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Network**
2. Select your connected network
3. Press the **Menu button** (☰ three lines)
4. Select **Forget Network**
5. Confirm by pressing **Select**

## Running Offline at Your Destination

When you arrive at your offline location:

1. Plug in your Fire Stick and turn on your TV
2. You'll see a "No internet connection" message - dismiss it
3. Press the **Home** button on your remote
4. Go to **Settings** → **Applications**
5. Select **Manage Installed Applications**
6. Scroll down and select **Sign Presenter**
7. Click **Launch Application**

**⚠️ Important:** Do NOT click "Clear Cache" - this will delete all your downloaded content!

Your screen will now run offline with all your cached content.

## Troubleshooting

- Verify your schedule is set to 24/7
- Check that you didn't clear the cache
