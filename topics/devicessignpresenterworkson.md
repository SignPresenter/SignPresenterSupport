### What Devices and or TVs does Sign Presenter work on?

Sign Presenter will work on any Amazon FireStick released in or after the year 2020. 

The most affordable Fire Stick is the [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3x7w5zj). (Our recommendation for digital signage)

The Lite means you will not be able to control the tv volume or power that you hook the firestick too. This is a great option for Digital signage.

### If you would like a Firestick that also controls your tv, any of the firesticks listed below work great.

[Fire TV Stick](https://amzn.to/3G6CElN) (Ideal for classroom use, perfect for running diverse curricula and presentations seamlessly on a TV.) 

[Fire TV Stick 4K](https://amzn.to/3NHUHE9) (Due to Fire OS 8, the Firestick no longer supports automatic reboots. Following a power surge, you'll need to manually launch SignPresenter.)

[Fire TV Stick 4K Max](https://amzn.to/3GYx1rd) (Due to Fire OS 8, the Firestick no longer supports automatic reboots. Following a power surge, you'll need to manually launch SignPresenter.)

If you want to buy a tv with the Amazon Firestick built in it you can buy the tvs listed below and Sign Presenter will work espesically well for running digital signage 24/7.

## Other notes

-As a general rule if you can search Signpresenter in the app store on any device and it shows up SignPresenter will work on your device.

- Older Fire-sticks: We are currently still running a legacy version of the app 1.9.9 it does work on some older Firesticks but because of their age they are not able to keep up with some videos. You will know you have one of these devices if SignPresenter requires you to login instead of pairing the firestick from the website. 
- The biggest issue is sometimes you will see a screen like this.

If this is happing to you we recomend updating the firestick with a [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3letCr1)

You can also follow the below steps to set the resoultion on the stick this will make the issue happen less but is not a complete fix.
