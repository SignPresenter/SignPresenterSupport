What Devices and or Tvs does Sign Presenter work on?

SignPresenter will work on any amazon FireStick released in or after the year 2020. The most affordable FireStick is the [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3letCr1).
The Lite means you will not be able to control the tv volume or power that you hook the fire-stick too which is great for Digital signage.
If you would like a Firestick that also controls your tv any of the firesticks listed below work great.
