What Devices and or TVs does Sign Presenter work on?

Sign Presenter will work on any Amazon FireStick released in or after the year 2020. The most affordable Fire Stick is the [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3letCr1).
The Lite means you will not be able to control the tv volume or power that you hook the firestick too. This is a great option for Digital signage.
