### What Devices and or TVs does Sign Presenter work on?

Sign Presenter will work on any Amazon FireStick released in or after the year 2020. 

The most affordable Fire Stick is the [Fire TV Stick Lite](https://amzn.to/3x7w5zj). (Our recommendation for digital signage)

The Lite means you will not be able to control the tv volume or power that you hook the firestick too. This is a great option for Digital signage.

### If you would like a Firestick that also controls your tv, any of the firesticks listed below work great.
