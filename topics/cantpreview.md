Some times you can't preview videos on signpresenter.com we recommend using a chrome browser but even then it is possible to get an error. 
Most of the time the videos work fine on the fire-sticks. You might get an error like this (NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact 
with the document first. https://goo.gl/xX8pDD) The preview popup shows this sometimes due to Chrome security issues preventing videos from autoplaying. 
If you just click anywhere in that popup while it's loading it'll get around those restrictions. As you use Sig-Presenter this will go away.
