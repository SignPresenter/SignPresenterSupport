## I can't preview my videos in Sign Presenter 

Some times when you can't preview videos on signpresenter.com, it can be as simple as your browser. We recommend using a chrome browser but even then 
it is possible to get an error. Most of the time the videos work fine on the fire-sticks however you might get an error like this 
*(NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first. https://goo.gl/xX8pDD)* 
The preview popup shows this sometimes due to Chrome security issues preventing videos from autoplaying. 
If you simply click anywhere in that popup while it's loading it'll get around those restrictions. As you continue to use Sign-Presenter this will go away.
