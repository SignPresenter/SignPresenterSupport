**Q: How much does it cost? What's the price? Sign Presenter pricing? Cost per screen? How much monthly?**
**A:** It's just $10/month per screen with unlimited schedules and storage, plus a 30-day free trial. No contracts, no hidden fees. Want to start your free trial now?

**Q: How does billing work after the 30-day free trial?**
**A:** SignPresenter offers a 30-day free trial for each new screen. After the trial ends, we bill on a pay-as-you-go basis, charging only for the screens you actively use. The billing amount depends on the number of screens and the duration they run. During the trial period, you can explore all features risk-free. After completing your initial account setup, your invoice will reflect only the active screens post-trial. You can view your current charges and manage your screens anytime in your SignPresenter account.

**Q: Why does my current month's invoice show a different amount than what I was charged?**
**A:** With SignPresenter, you are charged based on the screens you use each month. Charges are applied at the beginning of the following month based on that usage. The current month's invoice reflects only the usage so far, which may differ from your last charge if you've added or removed screens. For example, if you used multiple screens last month, your charge at the start of this month reflects that usage. If you've since reduced the number of screens, your current month's invoice will show that new amount, but you can always check your invoice for detailed billing information.

**Q: Can I print or download an electronic copy of my invoice?**
**A:** Yes, you can easily print or download an electronic copy of your invoice from SignPresenter.com. Follow these steps: Log in to SignPresenter.com.

## Technical Support

**Q: Why does my screen preview say it's not supported?**
**A:** If you're unable to preview videos on SignPresenter.com, the issue may be related to your browser. We recommend using Google Chrome for the best experience, but even then, you might encounter an error. A common issue is the following: Error: NotAllowedError: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first. This occurs due to Chrome's security restrictions, which prevent videos from autoplaying in the preview popup. To resolve this, click anywhere in the preview popup while it's loading. This action bypasses the restriction. Over time, as you continue using SignPresenter, this workaround typically won't be necessary because your usage builds up in the browser's history. Just note that this usually works fine on devices like Fire Sticks, even if the browser preview fails.

**Q: Do I need to update the app? App version? Latest update? Keep app current? Auto updates?**
**A:** Your FireTV will usually auto-update the app, but it's a good idea to check for updates regularly to ensure smooth performance. Need help checking your app version?

**Q: What file types can I upload? Image format? Video type? Media formats? Upload file type?**
**A:** We support JPG, PNG, MP4, and HTML formats. If you have something else, reach out—we may be able to help. Want help uploading your first file?

**Q: What happens if internet goes out? No connection? Internet issue? Temporary offline?**
**A:** Your screen will continue showing the last downloaded content until connection is restored. Messages won't stop. Want us to help set a backup plan?

**Q: Is there a storage limit? Upload limit? How much content can I have? Storage space?**
**A:** No limits! You get unlimited cloud storage for your media. That means all your playlists and custom messages are safe and ready anytime. Need help organizing your content?

**Q: Can I run more than one screen? Multiple TVs? Multi-location setup? Two screens? Several displays?**
**A:** Yes! Each screen requires a subscription, but you can manage them all from one dashboard. We make multi-screen setups easy. Want help configuring your locations?

**Q: Does this work offline? Do I need WiFi? Internet required? Offline support? No WiFi?**
**A:** You'll need a WiFi connection to download new content, but your screen can keep running cached messages if temporarily offline. Want us to test your setup speed?

**Q: Good evening. I have a client that is connected to a computer, acting as a monitor. When the doc is in the room, He/She is using it to review the client's X-Rays. The problem is, when the Doctor is out of the room, they would like some kind of signage going. Right now, they are using a Firestick for a part...is that possible?&nbsp;**
**A:** Hi, thanks for reaching out! SignPresenter is designed to work best with devices like Amazon Fire TV Sticks or Android-based players. If you're running SignPresenter from a computer that becomes inactive, the signage feed could stop if the computer goes to sleep. If the TV acts like a secondary monitor fed from a computer, the computer becomes inactive when no one's using it. TVs can detect when the HDMI signal from the computer stops and switch to another input. Here's the best approach: Connect the Fire TV Stick to the TV. TVs with multiple HDMI inputs can automatically switch inputs when needed. When the computer is in use, the TV can display the X-rays. When the computer is idle, the TV can switch to the Fire TV Stick input and show SignPresenter signage. While not completely automatic, this setup offers flexibility and lets SignPresenter work without needing a computer to stay on. To configure and set it up, you may need to manually switch the input on the TV between the computer and the SignPresenter device when needed, but the best approach would be to manually switch the input on the TV between the computer and the Fire TV Stick. Some TVs can be set to automatically switch between HDMI inputs, but that depends on your TV's specific features. If you'd prefer full automation, a professional AV setup with HDMI switchers and triggers could work, though that may be more complex than needed. For a low-cost solution that avoids compatibility issues with content that isn't suited for SignPresenter, the best approach would be to manually switch the input on the TV between the computer and the SignPresenter device when needed.

**Q: Can a computer running windows be used to deliver content to the firestick?**
**A:** Yes any computer with a browser can. The content is uploaded the cloud then downloaded to the FireStick.

**Q: How Do I access my Invoice?**
**A:** To access your invoice, you'll just need to log into your admin account on SignPresenter.com. Once you're logged in, click on your name (or your account name) at the top right of the page to head into your settings. Then, on the left-hand side, you'll see a Billing section where you can easily download any invoice you need from your account.

**Q: Will this work on my TV? Any screen support? Smart TV compatible? TV requirement?**
**A:** If your TV has an HDMI input, you're good to go! The FireTV Stick does all the work. Want to double-check your screen compatibility?

## Mobile Access

**Q: Can I manage this from my phone? Mobile access? Use on smartphone? Phone control? App on mobile?**
